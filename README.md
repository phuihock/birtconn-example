===
This is an example project to show how to work with birtconn, an open source BIRT connector for Odoo v7.

To see birtconn in action, please follow the following steps:

1. Run `git clone` this project
1. Run `git submodule update --init extras/birtconn` to initialize birtconn submodule
1. Run `CONF=./conf docker-compose up`
1. Go to *http://localhost:8069* and create a new database with demo data, say `test`
1. Login as user *admin*
1. Go to *Settings* and grant yourself permission to perform *Technical Features*
1. Install *report_birt* addon
1. Restart odoo `CONF=./conf docker-compose restart`. This is required to register birt report service.
